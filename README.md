# Connecting a smart contract to front end 
This repo shows how to connect a smart contract to front end.

## Tools
```node```
```hardhat```
```next.js```

## Assessment.sol
Contains a basic smart contract for minting and burning the tokens.

## deploy.js
Here we use the ethers.getContractFactory("Assessment") method to fetch our solidity smart contract and then deploy it.

## index.js
It is responsible for the front end.
This is where we write the jsx code and the functions to interact with the smart contract.
